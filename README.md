Currently, activities such as event coverage, mapping, analysis and monitoring of large areas constitute the core activity of certain companies. However, these activities become of great complexity to be performed due to the difficult access or large extension of the area in question, thus requiring the use of aerodynamic equipment. This research aims to study the feasibility of building a quadcopter with sensors that allow and stabilize the flight and is justified by the adoption of low cost devices in its construction. This is an experimental research that consists in the literature review of works published in the area that will be the basis for the design of a prototype with stability control. The work is expected to contribute to the design of aerodynamic devices employing low cost components. The access and use of drones can be enhanced with the use of simple and commercial devices in their manufacture.
